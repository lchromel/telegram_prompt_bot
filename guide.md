- *A woman eating, texting, waving, and opening the door.*

Add an Emotional Layer

Even simple actions become expressive when they carry **inner emotion**. We avoid exaggerated grimaces or fake commercial smiles — we use **subtle, truthful expressions**, like in strong street or fashion photography.

### Emotions That Work:
**Calm / Cold**
*expressionless, jaw slightly tense, sharp eyes, neutral lips*
suits confident, fashion-forward looks

**Focused / Self-assured**
*calm focus, soft smirk, relaxed face, present but unreadable*
works for everyday or working scenes

**Lightness / Inspiration**
*gentle smile while looking down, subtle contentment, light posture*
fits quiet, inspiring moments

**Laughter — only between people**
*two people laughing naturally while doing something together*
allowed during interaction, but **not solo**

### Character Appearance  
[keywords: street fashion, layered, textured, accessories, visual hooks]

- Style: Street fashion — eclectic, layered, textured  
- Must-have: Accessories — nails, glasses, jewelry, standout elements  
- Avoid: Plain outfits, "office" looks, over-polished styling  


### Clothing

- dusty pavement, puddles, crumbling facades, taped posters, neon signs

**Examples:**
- on a cracked sidewalk in downtown Accra, with honking minibuses and street food smoke
- under faded billboards in central Medellín, next to a red tuk-tuk and stacked crates
- walking through a concrete alley in Cairo, graffiti walls and tangled wires overhead
- near a corner shop in Kinshasa, yellow kiosk with hand-painted ads, puddles on the street

## Ride-Hail 
[keywords: car, tuk tuk, motorcycle, red vehicle, Yaris, Picanto]

- Use white compact cars common and respectful for the country (Yaris, Picanto)  
- Driver is seated 
- Tuk-tuks and motorcycles should always be red  
- Passengers always sit in the back seat of the car  

### Walking to the car
Rules:
– The passenger is walking to or from the rear door of a white car
- The driver is already behind the wheel
- The shot captures only one side of the street (side view): building façades, storefronts, gates, textured walls — not a full street overview

Composition is slightly angled, often from the side or low

Examples:
“A woman walking toward the rear door of a white Toyota Yaris, her hand reaching for the handle. Behind her: pastel-painted walls, closed shopfronts, and a hanging wire. The driver is behind the wheel.”

“A man walking away from the car, one foot on the sidewalk, framed by chipped walls and a metal gate. The white Yaris is parked along the curb. Side view with soft golden light.”

### Getting out of the car
Rules:
– The passenger is getting out from the rear seat
– The driver is behind the wheel, but no mirrors or interior reflections are shown
– The shot shows physical motion: one leg out, torso turning, hand on the door

✅ Examples:
“A woman getting out of the back seat of a white Toyota Yaris, her heel touching the sidewalk. The driver is behind the wheel.”

“A man stepping out, holding a bag close to his body, door wide open. The light casts long shadows across the side of the car.”

### Sitting in the back seat of a car
Rules:
– Shot is from inside the car, showing only the back seat
– The driver is not mentioned
- The background is visible through the car window, showing local architecture or streetscape

Describe the interior: seat textures, materials, light reflections

Examples:
“A girl sitting in the back seat of a white Yaris, scrolling through her phone. Through the window: concrete balconies and faded posters. Light hits the stitched leather seat.”

“A young man leaning back on a grey fabric headrest, phone in one hand. The street outside glows in a blur of graffiti walls and electric cables.”

### Sitting in the back of a tuk tuk
Rules:
- The passenger is always seated in the rear bench of the tuk tuk
- The driver is present, simply described as “at the wheel” — no close detail
- Framing may be from the side, from inside, or through the opening

Examples:
“A woman sitting in the back of a red tuk tuk, one hand resting on her lap, the other holding her phone. The driver is at the wheel.”

“A man seated in the back, looking out sideways, legs slightly apart. Flash lights up the vinyl seat. The driver is in front.”

### Sitting on the back of a motorcycle
Rules:
- Use clear phrasing: “A person sitting behind the driver on the back of a motorbike”
- The driver is always present but only mentioned, not described
- Passenger is slightly off-balance or holding something

Examples:
“A woman sitting behind the driver on the back of a motorbike, one hand gripping the seat. Her tote bag pressed between her side and the driver’s back.”

“A man sitting behind the driver, legs bent up slightly, holding a food box on his knees.”

### Holding a phone with the vehicle in the background
Rules:
- Focus is on the passenger’s hand and phone — nails, rings, sleeves
- The vehicle is visible in the background, slightly blurred or partially framed (door, wheel, driver silhouette)
- The hand must be doing something: tapping, holding, swiping

Examples:
“Close-up of a hand with neon nails holding a phone, ride-hailing app open. In the background: a red tuk tuk with the driver at the wheel.”

“A woman holding her phone in front of her chest. The side of a white Yaris is visible behind, driver faintly seen through the glass.”


## Food Delivery  
[keywords: food, steam, eating, home, interaction]

[keywords: courier, box, red top, handoff, biking]

- Courier in red top + black bottom (optional red cap)  
- Red kraft box (unbranded)  
- Show: knocking, hand-off, biking, standing with parcel
