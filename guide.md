## Characters  
[keywords: clothing, personality, accessories, realism]

Always specify the character’s nationality — for example, Colombian woman, Senegalese man, Zambian girl, Peruvian courier, Nigerian teenager etc.

Use precise present-tense verbs:

**The character should always perform only one action**
Good example: A girl walking parallel to the car
Bad example: A girl zipping her backpack, holding a phone

**Use precise present-tense verbs:** Stepping into, Biting into, Reaching for, Glancing toward, Holding, Fixing, Adjusting, Carrying, Offering, Zipping, Tapping, Squinting, Laughing, Waiting, Handing over

**Avoid:** *Posing, Standing still, Smiling at the camera, Portrait of*

**Examples (Do):**

- *A woman stepping out of a white Toyota Yaris*
- *A courier knocking on a gate with a delivery box under his arm...*
- *A young girl zipping her backpack*

**Examples (Don’t):**

- *A man holding a bag, looking around, fixing his jacket, walking toward the car.*
- *A woman eating, texting, waving, and opening the door.*
- *A teenager running, talking to someone, holding balloons, and smiling.*

Add an Emotional Layer

Even simple actions become expressive when they carry **inner emotion**. We avoid exaggerated grimaces or fake commercial smiles — we use **subtle, truthful expressions**, like in strong street or fashion photography.

### Emotions That Work:
**Calm / Cold**
*expressionless, jaw slightly tense, sharp eyes, neutral lips*
suits confident, fashion-forward looks

**Focused / Self-assured**
*calm focus, soft smirk, relaxed face, present but unreadable*
works for everyday or working scenes

**Lightness / Inspiration**
*gentle smile while looking down, subtle contentment, light posture*
fits quiet, inspiring moments

**Laughter — only between people**
*two people laughing naturally while doing something together*
allowed during interaction, but **not solo**

### Character Appearance  
[keywords: street fashion, layered, textured, accessories, visual hooks]

- Style: Street fashion — eclectic, layered, textured  
- Must-have: Accessories — nails, glasses, jewelry, standout elements  
- Avoid: Plain outfits, "office" looks, over-polished styling  


### Clothing
[keywords: street fashion, layered, textured, accessories, visual hooks]
## Women’s Looks — Local Street Fashion

Convey personality through a **modern, eclectic look** with cultural accents.

Note: This is **street fashion**, not mass-market. Combinations should be bold but authentic. Accessories should be present, but not overdone.

**What works:**

- **Layers and textures:** mesh, leather, denim, knitwear, sheer fabrics
- **Modern hairstyles:** braids, buns, loose waves, flyaways
- **Hair accessories:** bright clips, metallic beads, scarves, wraps
- **Nails:** long, designed nails — a key visual element
- **Clothing:** a mix of athletic, ethnic, and casual wear
- **Shoes:** chunky sneakers, platforms, open sandals

**Examples:**

- *Wearing a cropped mesh top under a loose denim jacket, layered beaded necklaces, yellow acrylic nails with cartoon decals*
- *Braided hair with colorful clips and silver beads, scarf tied as a headband, glossy lips and bold hoop earrings*

## Men’s Looks — Local Street Fashion

**Goal:** Express confidence and style through a **fashion blended street look**. Never overloaded — but there must be a statement. Accessories should be present, but minimal.

**What works:**

- **Cultural fusion:** traditional patterns in modern cuts, southern tunics with sneakers
- **Modern haircuts:** shaved sides, curls, color accents, neat braids
- **Headwear and scarves:** skullcaps, wraps, bucket hats, bandanas
- **Jewelry:** chains, earrings, rings, belt bags
- **Clothing:** open shirts, vintage tees, sporty pants with flair
- **Shoes:** sneakers, bulky trainers, sandals with socks

**Example Phrases:**

- *Wearing a patterned tunic over jogger pants, layered with a bomber, gold ring on one hand and beaded bracelet on the other*
- *Short fade haircut with dyed tips, wraparound shades, and a silk scarf tied around the neck*

### Emotion & Posing  
[keywords: natural emotion, movement, walking, glancing, no eye contact]

- Emotion: Honest, subtle — focused, calm, neutral, or quietly fierce  
- Pose: In motion — walking, lifting, glancing. Never staged  
- Eyes: Not at camera — look away, sideways, down  

---

## Locations  
[keywords: urban, context, street, interior, real places]

Showcase country and culture through vibrant, real city context.

Locations must be **urban**, **realistic**, with **texture and personality**.

**Avoid:** parks, trees, greenery, "rural aesthetics."

### Urban Streets (Exterior)

**What works:**
- narrow city alleys*, concrete courtyards, roadside kiosks, *bus terminals, market crossings
- vendors, traffic, signs, exposed wires, billboards, graffiti
- dusty pavement, puddles, crumbling facades, taped posters, neon signs

**Examples:**
- on a cracked sidewalk in downtown Accra, with honking minibuses and street food smoke
- under faded billboards in central Medellín, next to a red tuk-tuk and stacked crates
- walking through a concrete alley in Cairo, graffiti walls and tangled wires overhead
- near a corner shop in Kinshasa, yellow kiosk with hand-painted ads, puddles on the street

**Avoid:**
- trees, palms, grass
- green parks or rural scenery
- country roads or "nature scenes"

**Rules:**
Always show the street from the side — a side-view perspective of a single side of the street: building façades, shop entrances, textured walls, balconies, cables.

Do not show wide symmetrical views of the whole street or street stretching into depth.
Do not describe the time of day in a stylized or cinematic way — avoid phrases like:
“against the harsh midday sun”
“bathed in golden hour light”
“morning haze”, “sunset glow”

Lighting should feel realistic and incidental, like ambient daylight or shadow from nearby buildings.

**Good Examples:**
“A woman walking along a narrow sidewalk, passing faded pink walls and a blue metal gate. Shot from the side, the white car is parked close to the building.”

“A man opening the rear door of a Yaris parked tight against a graffiti-covered wall.”

“A girl stepping toward a tuk tuk, only one side of the street is visible: old apartment balconies, peeling paint, and a broken sign above a metal shop gate.”

**Bad Examples:**
“A man walking down the middle of the street, buildings on both sides, golden hour sun behind him.”
Too wide. Too cinematic.

“A woman stepping out of a car as harsh sunlight flares across the road.”
Avoid stylized sunlight. Keep light natural and unremarkable.

### Background Activity 

The street should never feel empty. There should always be other people present — pedestrians, vendors, cyclists, seated figures — naturally integrated into the environment.

These background characters should appear:
in the background, walking, selling, talking, riding
or in the foreground, out of focus (blurred), cropped, partially visible

They should always be busy with their own tasks — not looking at the camera, not posing, and not interacting directly with the main character.

Use everyday street elements to support realism: benches, bicycles, crates, plants, laundry, handcarts, roadside chairs.

**Good Examples:**
“A woman walking toward a parked Yaris, while a cyclist passes by in the background. Farther behind, a vendor arranges mangoes on a wooden cart.”

“A man getting out of a car as a blurred figure crosses the frame in the foreground, holding plastic bags. Behind him, people sit on a bench under a shop awning.”

“A girl stepping into a tuk tuk. On the sidewalk behind her: an older man reads a newspaper near a cluster of potted plants. A boy walks a bicycle past the camera, slightly out of focus.”

**Bad Examples:**
“A man standing on an empty street, no one else around.”
Feels artificial and staged.

“A woman walking alone on a clean, symmetrical sidewalk.”
Too sterile. Missing texture and life.

## Ride-Hail 
[keywords: car, tuk tuk, motorcycle, red vehicle, Yaris, Picanto]

- Use white compact cars common and respectful for the country (Yaris, Picanto)  
- Driver is seated 
- Tuk-tuks and motorcycles should always be red  
- Passengers always sit in the back seat of the car  

### Walking to the car
Rules:
– The passenger is walking to or from the rear door of a white car
- The passenger can be walking parallel to the car
- The driver is already behind the wheel
- The shot captures only one side of the street (side view): building façades, storefronts, gates, textured walls — not a full street overview

Composition is slightly angled, often from the side or low

Examples:
“A woman walking toward the rear door of a white Toyota Yaris, her hand reaching for the handle. Behind her: pastel-painted walls, closed shopfronts, and a hanging wire. The driver is behind the wheel.”

“A man walking away from the car, one foot on the sidewalk, framed by chipped walls and a metal gate. The white Yaris is parked along the curb. Side view with soft golden light.”

### Getting out of the car
Rules:
– The passenger is getting out from the rear seat
– The driver is behind the wheel, but no mirrors or interior reflections are shown
– The shot shows physical motion: one leg out, torso turning, hand on the door

Examples:
“A woman getting out of the back seat of a white Toyota Yaris, her heel touching the sidewalk. The driver is behind the wheel.”

“A man stepping out, holding a bag close to his body, door wide open. The light casts long shadows across the side of the car.”

### Sitting in the back seat of a car
Rules:
– Shot is from inside the car, showing only the back seat
– The driver is not mentioned
- The background is visible through the car window, showing local architecture or streetscape

Describe the interior: seat textures, materials, light reflections

Examples:
“A girl sitting in the back seat of a white Yaris, scrolling through her phone. Through the window: concrete balconies and faded posters. Light hits the stitched leather seat.”

“A young man leaning back on a grey fabric headrest, phone in one hand. The street outside glows in a blur of graffiti walls and electric cables.”

### Sitting in the back of a tuk tuk
Rules:
- The passenger is always seated in the rear bench of the tuk tuk
- The driver is present, simply described as “at the wheel” — no close detail
- Framing may be from the side, from inside, or through the opening

Examples:
“A woman sitting in the back of a red tuk tuk, one hand resting on her lap, the other holding her phone. The driver is at the wheel.”

“A man seated in the back, looking out sideways, legs slightly apart. Flash lights up the vinyl seat. The driver is in front.”

### Sitting on the back of a motorcycle
Rules:
- Use clear phrasing: “A person sitting behind the driver on the back of a motorbike”
- The driver is always present but only mentioned, not described
- Passenger is slightly off-balance or holding something

Examples:
“A woman sitting behind the driver on the back of a motorbike, one hand gripping the seat. Her tote bag pressed between her side and the driver’s back.”

“A man sitting behind the driver, legs bent up slightly, holding a food box on his knees.”

### Holding a phone with the vehicle in the background
Rules:
- Focus is on the passenger’s hand and phone — nails, rings, sleeves
- The vehicle is visible in the background, slightly blurred or partially framed (door, wheel, driver silhouette)
- The hand must be doing something: tapping, holding, swiping

Examples:
“Close-up of a hand with neon nails holding a phone, ride-hailing app open. In the background: a red tuk tuk with the driver at the wheel.”

“A woman holding her phone in front of her chest. The side of a white Yaris is visible behind, driver faintly seen through the glass.”


## Food Delivery  
[keywords: food, steam, eating, home, interaction]

- Focus on delicious food — sauce, steam, textures  
- Include eating, serving, setting, or close-up food details  
- Use dynamic food interaction scenes  

## Parcel Delivery  
[keywords: courier, box, red top, handoff, biking]

- Courier in red top + black bottom (optional red cap)  
- Red kraft box (unbranded)  
- Show: knocking, hand-off, biking, standing with parcel
