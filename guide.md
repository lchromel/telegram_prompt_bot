# SUPER APP VISUAL GUIDE
Urban Fashion × Documentary Realism

This guide defines strict visual rules for image generation.
The goal is clean, believable, fashion-forward urban scenes grounded in real life.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- One or two main characters only
- Clear, readable action
- Fashion is dominant
- Environment supports, never overwhelms
- Scenes must read as real exterior city moments
- Clothing must match season and weather
- Time of day must match the scenario logic

---

## CHARACTERS

### Number of characters
- Default: one main character
- Allowed: two main characters when the scenario implies interaction
  (friends, couple, siblings, passengers together)

### Interaction rules (for two characters)
- Characters may interact only with each other
- Interaction must support the scenario (talking, laughing, leaning closer, sharing a moment)
- Both characters must be visible in the frame
- Interaction should feel natural, not staged

---

## ACTION RULES

- One clear action per character
- Present tense
- No posing
- No eye contact with the camera
- Emotion is subtle and authentic

---

## PHONE RULE (IMPORTANT)

- At least ONE character should be holding or using a phone when contextually appropriate
- Phone interaction must be natural:
  holding, scrolling, showing something to the other person
- Phone use should support the story, not distract from it

---

## FASHION & STYLE

Street fashion must feel:
- Bold
- Confident
- Slightly overstyled

Use at least ONE:
- Strong color contrast
- Unexpected layering
- Statement accessory

Avoid:
- Safe, neutral, minimal looks
- Over-accessorizing

---

## SEASONAL CLOTHING RULE (CRITICAL)

Clothing MUST reflect the current season and climate of the country.

- Hot / summer climate:
  lightweight fabrics, short sleeves, open silhouettes
  no coats, puffers, scarves, or heavy layers

- Mild or cool weather:
  light jackets, denim, windbreakers, layered tops

- Cold weather:
  coats, puffers, knitwear, scarves, gloves when appropriate

Never mix summer clothing with cold conditions or vice versa.

---

## CLOTHING RESTRICTIONS

- No traditional, ethnic, folkloric, or ceremonial clothing
- No ethnic prints or full traditional outfits
- Global street fashion only

### Grooming rules
- Women: bold manicures allowed
- Men: **NO visible manicures or painted nails**
  (hands must appear natural and unstyled)

---

## TIME OF DAY LOGIC (NEW — CRITICAL)

Time of day must be inferred from the scenario.

Examples:
- Going to a party, nightlife, social plans → evening or night
- Commuting, errands, deliveries → daytime
- Early work, school-related scenes → morning
- Relaxed homebound rides → late afternoon or evening

Never choose time of day randomly.
Time must support the story naturally.

Lighting should reflect this choice realistically, without cinematic language.

---

## LOCATION — EXTERIOR LOGIC

Never use words:
street, alley, road, market, sidewalk

Describe locations through **architectural context only**.

Every exterior scene MUST include:
- A building surface
- A transition element (entrance, doorway, corner, gate, step, threshold)
- Spatial positioning (beside, near, along, adjacent to)

The description must clearly signal:
“This is outside, next to a building in a city.”

---

## REALISM (USED, NOT RUINED)

Urban environments should feel:
- Used
- Maintained
- Lived-in

Avoid:
- Extreme decay
- Slum-like deterioration
- Overly distressed textures

Optional realism details (max 1–2):
- Curtains behind windows
- Plants near entrances
- Door numbers or intercoms
- Light reflections on glass or car paint
- Shadows from nearby buildings

---

## VEHICLE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Passenger logic
- Passengers are ALWAYS in the back seat
- If inside the car: **Seat belt fastened** (mandatory)

### Approaching / exiting a car
- Only rear door
- Never front door
- Driver is already inside

### Driver visibility
- Driver always exists logically
- If the scene focuses on passengers inside the car:
  the driver must NOT be visible in any way
  (no windshield views, no reflections, no silhouettes)

- Describe the driver ONLY if explicitly required
- If visible, describe ONLY the visible part (arm, shoulder, cap edge)

---

## BACKGROUND CONTROL

- Optional
- Maximum ONE secondary background figure
- May be blurred, cropped, or partially visible
- Never interacting with main characters

Empty backgrounds are allowed and often preferred.

---

## CAMERA & COMPOSITION

- Side view or slightly angled
- Cropped, asymmetrical framing
- No wide establishing shots
- Fashion-documentary feel

---

## LIGHT

- Natural or flash light only
- Used to reveal texture and material
- No cinematic or poetic lighting language

---

## FINAL SANITY CHECK

If:
- clothing doesn’t match season
- time of day doesn’t match scenario
- men have visible manicures
- interaction feels staged
- driver appears unnecessarily

→ the prompt is invalid and must be rewritten.
