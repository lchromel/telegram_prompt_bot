# Super App Visual Guidelines - Revised

## Core Principles

**Style**: Documentary realism × urban fashion  
**Subjects**: Real people (customers, drivers, couriers)  
**Approach**: Unposed, genuine, mid-action moments  
**Quality**: Natural lighting, no heavy filters or styling

## Character Guidelines

### Nationality Requirements
Always specify character's nationality (e.g., Colombian woman, Senegalese man, Zambian girl, Nigerian courier)

### Action Rules
**ONE ACTION ONLY** - Character performs a single, specific action
- ✅ Good: "stepping into", "reaching for", "holding", "adjusting"  
- ❌ Avoid: Multiple actions, posing, smiling at camera

### Emotional Expression
**Subtle and authentic expressions only**
- Calm/focused: neutral expression, sharp eyes
- Confident: soft smirk, relaxed face  
- Light contentment: gentle downward glance
- Laughter: only between multiple people, never solo
