# AI Prompting Guide (Super App Style)

## 🧭 Core Style
- **Documentary realism** + **fashion-forward vibe**
- Inspired by *Magnum Photos* + *Bottega Veneta*
- Characters = real people (customers, drivers, couriers)
- Scene = “caught in the moment” — never posed

## 📸 Composition & Camera
- **Angles:** Dutch tilt, low/high, over-the-shoulder
- **Shot types:**
  - *Wide* – shows environment
  - *Medium* – interaction
  - *Close-up* – details (hands, logos, texture)
- **Feel:** spontaneous, imperfect, expressive

## 🧍‍♂️ Character & Action
- 1 main subject, 1 clear action
- Use strong verbs: stepping into, adjusting, handing over
- No posing or smiling at camera
- Emotion: subtle, stylish (not commercial smiles)

## 👗 Clothing / Appearance
- Urban street style — layered, textured, accessorized
- Key visuals: nails, braids, scarves, bold shoes
- Avoid bland office looks or fashion catalog symmetry

## 🏙️ Location
- Real, urban, textural (markets, courtyards, kiosks)
- Avoid parks or generic green areas
- Interiors: cozy, lived-in, emotional

## 🌤️ Light & Mood
- Use time + light for cinematic feel
- Morning sun, evening glow, flash at night
- Color from environment — no filters or fake grading

## 🧩 Prompt Structure
1. **Main character + action**
2. **Clothing / appearance**
3. **Location / surroundings**
4. **Time / atmosphere**
5. **Background elements**
6. **Photography style / angle**

## ✅ Examples (Do)
> A courier handing a red box through a gate, eyes focused, mid-step  
> A teen zipping her yellow backpack on a dusty street, nails glossy, shot low-angle

## ❌ Avoid (Don't)
- Posing, looking at camera, "portrait of"
- Smooth, studio lighting
- Overdone smiles or unnatural emotion

### Characters and Fashion Style
**Eclectic fashion**: Stylish but not generic. Mix local, sporty, and designer pieces. Formal clothes with quirky twists are welcome. Avoid bland looks.

**Accessories and styling**: Bold accessories elevate a character – e.g., pink caps, avant-garde glasses, nail art. Hairstyles and expressive elements add narrative depth.

**Cultural mix**: Blend cultural elements to reflect a global brand – but always tastefully and relevantly.

### Models: Charisma, Emotions, and Poses
**Casting**: Charismatic, expressive individuals over polished supermodels. Diversity is key.

**Emotions**: Aim for honest, situation-appropriate emotion. Avoid aimless smiling at the camera.

**Poses**: As natural as possible – caught mid-gesture, mid-step, or while interacting. Group shots and side characters enrich the scene.

### Framing and Scale
**Shot variety**: Use wide, medium, and close-up shots. Establish setting, character interaction, and storytelling details.

**Detail focus**: Don’t be afraid to crop creatively. Focus on hands, objects, or partial figures if it supports the narrative.

## Technical Part (Prompt Generation and Description)

### General Guidelines
- **Prompt language**: Use English for better results, especially with Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Russian can work, but English ensures consistency.
- **Specificity and detail**: Be precise – define who the subject is, what they’re doing, where and when it happens, and the mood. Avoid vague phrases like “a person on street” – instead say “a young man in a hoodie carrying a food delivery backpack, walking through a crowded night market”.
- **Style and camera angle**: Mention photographic techniques and styles like “candid photo”, “documentary style”, “flash photograph”, “Dutch angle”, etc. Describe lighting – “harsh flash shadows”, “soft warm streetlights”, etc. Mention natural color tones.
- **Character description**: Include personality in styling – e.g., “bright pink cap and quirky glasses”, “freckles and a gap-toothed smile”. Specify emotion and activity – “laughing while handing over a package”, “determined expression while cycling”.
- **Location description**: Ground the scene in reality – specify city/street/weather. Use phrases like “narrow residential street in Mumbai”, “Cyrillic shop signs in background”.
- **Action and mood**: Describe what’s happening and set the emotional tone: “courier sprinting across the street in rain” – mood is urgent. Use adjectives like “joyful”, “tense”, “hectic”.
- **Syntax tips**:
  - Midjourney: Use commas, e.g., “Photo of a courier, candid, flash, urban street, motion blur --ar 3:2”.
  - Stable Diffusion: Use weight syntax or negative prompts like “low quality, blurry” to refine output.
  - DALL·E: Use full sentences, e.g., “A candid photo of a courier running up a staircase in São Paulo.”

### Recommended Prompt Structure
1. **Main character and action** – who, what are they doing
2. **Appearance/outfit** – key visual traits
3. **Location** – where it happens, with real-world context
4. **Time/atmosphere** – lighting, time of day, mood
5. **Background elements** – supporting details to enrich realism
6. **Style and technique** – camera angle, motion, lighting style



### Global Style Localization

- **Architecture/environment**: Mention local elements like “colonial-era balconies”, “bustling bazaar”, “tram rails”.
- **Signs/language**: Hints like “Arabic graffiti”, “Japanese shop signs” help ground the location. Don’t use full texts.
- **Cultural appearance**: Mention clothing/accessories appropriate for region – sari in India, hijab in the Middle East, etc.
- **Local transport**: Include yellow taxis (NYC), danfo buses (Lagos), scooters (Asia), etc., in the background.
- **Light/climate**: Adjust lighting based on geography: “harsh midday sun in Mexico City”, “soft light in Scandinavia”.
- **Consistency**: Despite localization, keep the style coherent – real, dynamic, documentary. Think: same brand, local photographer.
