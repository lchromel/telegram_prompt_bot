# General Recommendations

## **Overall Style**

### Aesthetic and Visual Principles

**Overall Style**

Super App merges the documentary realism of Magnum Photos with the stylish sensibility of Bottega Veneta fashion campaigns. The protagonists are real people — customers, drivers, couriers. Each shot captures what feels like a spontaneously observed moment from real life.

**Unstaged Reportage**

- Subjects don’t pose. No direct eye contact with the camera.
- Emotions are genuine, not performed.
- The photographer is an observer, not a participant.

**Dynamics and Angles**

- Unusual angles, tilted horizons, low or high viewpoints are encouraged.
- Motion blur is allowed when it emphasizes movement.
- Shots should feel alive, slightly chaotic — like life itself.

**Hyperlocal Locations**

- Street: courtyards, markets, bus stops, transportation — real places, not a polished cityscape.
- Interiors: “lived-in” and personal — full of details, slightly cluttered but cozy.
    
    Avoid showroom-style or IKEA-like interiors.
    
- Atmosphere must feel authentic, with urban background noise and random passersby.

**Light and Color**

- Flash and harsh light are acceptable.
- Colors should be natural — no filters or excessive grading.
- Brightness should come from detail and storytelling, not editing.

**Character Clothing and Style**

- Style: **Street Fashion** — eclectic, urban, unexpected combinations.
- Always feature **bold manicures for women**, adding to the character.
- Highlight **cool, standout accessories**: glasses, bags, jewelry, hairstyles.
- Clothing must have personality. Dull or “office” looks are anti-references.
- Cultural mix is welcome **if modern, non-stereotypical, and seamlessly integrated** — e.g., African prints with designer sneakers or a traditional element in an urban look.

**Models and Emotion**

- **Character archetype** — focused, modern, confident. These are active participants in city life, not random passersby.
- **Not glossy supermodels** but people with charisma and distinct features — expressive looks, a gaze with history, individuality.
- **Emotion** — more neutral or subtly fierce (a hint of a “bitch face”), as in fashion photography. Avoid “smiling at camera” or unjustified happiness.
- Convey internal states: focus, energy, slight tiredness — anything honest for the scene.
- **Poses** — in motion, natural, never staged. Subjects are “living” inside the frame.
- **Secondary characters** add realism and help build context.

**Composition and Framing**

- **Vary framing**: wide to show context, medium for action, close-up for details (logo, hands, food, app, emotion).
- **Avoid ideal symmetry** — slight messiness, cropping, and spontaneity make it feel alive. Don’t fear “cutting” the scene for expressiveness.
- **Unusual angles encouraged**:
    - Dutch tilt for energy.
    - Low angle to empower the subject.
    - High angle to give a sense of observation.
- **Avoid sterile, over-polished frames.** Instead: dynamism, a sense of the moment — like the photo was taken by a bystander.
- **Every shot should tell a story**, even if it’s just one frame.

# Prompt Structure

### 1. Main Character and Action

Who is the focus of the image, and what are they doing?

**Example:***a young delivery courier riding a scooter*

### 2. Clothing/Appearance

Brief description of how the person looks — especially if relevant to the scene.

**Example:***...wearing a bright green jacket and a pink cap*

### 3. Location and Surroundings

Where is the action happening? Include specific details.

**Example:***...through a narrow street in Istanbul, past old apartment buildings*

### 4. Time and Atmosphere

Mention time of day, lighting, weather, mood.

**Example:***...at dusk in light rain, city lights starting to glow*

### 5. Background Elements

What’s happening around the subject?

**Example:***...pedestrians blur in the background, neon shop signs in Turkish visible*

### 6. Photography Style and Angle

Add technical/stylistic notes.

**Example:***...candid photo, motion blur, low-angle shot with flash*

# Main Character and Action (Expanded)

Every prompt starts with the main character and what they’re doing. This is the foundation — the base of the visual narrative.

The person isn’t just “present” in the shot — they’re doing something, interacting, experiencing — and that’s how the emotion comes through.

### Character + Action

Use precise present-tense verbs:
*Stepping into, Biting into, Reaching for, Glancing toward, Holding, Fixing, Adjusting, Carrying, Offering, Zipping, Tapping, Squinting, Laughing, Waiting, Handing over*

**Use:***Caught mid-step, In the act of handing over, Glancing sideways while chewing, Mid-laugh*

**Avoid:***Posing, Standing still, Smiling at the camera, Portrait of*

**Examples (Do):**

- *A woman stepping out of a white Toyota Yaris, adjusting her sunglasses...*
- *A courier knocking on a gate with a delivery box under his arm...*
- *A young girl zipping her backpack*

**Examples (Don’t):**

- *A man holding a bag, looking around, fixing his jacket, walking toward the car.*
- *A woman eating, texting, waving, and opening the door.*
- *A teenager running, talking to someone, holding balloons, and smiling.*

### The Scene Should Feel “Caught in the Moment”

### 1. Character in Motion or Action

**Important:** They should be **doing something**, not just standing.

Phrases that work well: *"mid-motion"*, *"while doing..."*, *"caught in the act of..."*

**Examples:**

- *A woman adjusting her scarf while stepping out of a tuk tuk*
- *A courier lifting a delivery box with one hand while unlocking a gate*
- *A teenager mid-bite into a sandwich, cheeks puffed slightly*

---

### 2. Lived-In, Imperfect Clothing

**Important:** Clothes shouldn’t look store-fresh. Small “flaws” make them real.

Phrases that work well: *"collar turned up"*, *"strap slipping"*, *"shirt caught under bag"*

**Examples:**

- *Her jacket collar turned up on one side, bag strap slipping off her shoulder*
- *His shirt slightly stuck under the edge of a delivery box*
- *Scarf half-loosened, ends fluttering in the breeze*

---

### 3. Imperfect, Uneven Movements

**Important:** The scene should feel in progress — not a pose, but action.

Good phrases: *"mid-step"*, *"shifting weight"*, *"leaning while..."*

**Examples:**

- *She’s stepping off the curb, one heel still in the air*
- *He’s shifting a bag from one hand to the other, fingers tensed unevenly*
- *She’s leaning down to grab something, hair falling across her face*

---

### 4. Eyes Looking Away, Not at Camera

**Important:** No eye contact. Eyes should look **at something, to the side, down, forward**.

Phrases: *"looking down"*, *"eyes turned toward..."*, *"not facing camera"*

**Examples:**

- *Looking down at her phone while walking*
- *Eyes turned toward the driver, face unreadable*
- *Glancing over her shoulder mid-step*
- *Staring out the car window, brows slightly furrowed*

---

### Avoid Words/Images Like:

- “**posing**”, “**smiling at the camera**”, “**portrait of**”, “**facing viewer**”
- Perfectly symmetrical framing
- Lifeless clothing (like on mannequins)
- Studio lighting or staged setups

---

### Add an Emotional Layer

Even simple actions become expressive when they carry **inner emotion**. We avoid exaggerated grimaces or fake commercial smiles — we use **subtle, truthful expressions**, like in strong street or fashion photography.

### Emotions That Work:

**Calm / Cold**

*expressionless, jaw slightly tense, sharp eyes, neutral lips*

→ suits confident, fashion-forward looks

**Focused / Self-assured**

*calm focus, soft smirk, relaxed face, present but unreadable*

→ works for everyday or working scenes

**Lightness / Inspiration**

*gentle smile while looking down, subtle contentment, light posture*

→ fits quiet, inspiring moments

**Laughter — only between people**

*two people laughing naturally while doing something together*

→ allowed during interaction, but **not solo**

---

### Good Examples:

- *A woman zipping her bag, eyes down, lips pressed, focused expression*
- *A courier handing a package, face calm, eyes alert*
- *Two teens laughing mid-step, one holding a delivery bag, turned toward each other*

---

### Avoid:

- *Smiling at the camera*
- *Laughing alone with no reason*
- *Overacting (shock, drama, exaggerated expressions)*

---

### Remember:

- ✔ Subtle emotion is better than exaggerated
- ✔ Laugh only if it’s shared
- ✖ Don’t use "portrait", "happy person", "smiling at viewer"

# Clothing / Appearance

Clothing should not simply “be there” — it must **enhance the character**. A character is remembered through details, layers, accessories, and a sense of style. We don’t show generic fashion or dull everyday looks — only **eclecticism, contrast, and personality**.

### General Rules

- **Style:** local street fashion / urban eclectic
- **The look must be memorable** — through layering, color, texture, and detail
- **Always add accessories or a visual hook** — glasses, bags, hairstyle, nails, shoelaces
- **Cultural mix is encouraged** if relevant — especially in small touches

**Keywords:***layered*, *textured*, *contrasting fabrics*, *bold accessories*, *mismatched*, *fashion-forward*

---

# Photography Style and Angles

**Goal:** Convey **context, energy, and moment** — not symmetry or perfection.

Should feel **real**, like a movie still shot on location.

### 🔍 Shot Sizes

**Wide shot:**

Shows the subject in their environment — helps set context.

Examples:

- *A young man stepping out of a white Yaris on a narrow street in Kampala, motorbikes passing behind him*
- *On a rooftop in Cairo, a courier adjusts his helmet with the skyline in the distance*

**Medium shot:**

Focus on the body, action, pose, or interaction.

Examples:

- *A courier handing over a package through a gate, hands meeting mid-frame*
- *Two teens laughing, holding drinks and bags, framed waist-up*

**Close-up:**

Details: hands, food, logos, screens, manicure, texture.

Examples:

- *Close-up of acrylic nails opening a food box, rings catching phone light*
- *Beaded bracelet resting on a handlebar, dust on fingers visible*

**Extreme Close-Up:**

Focus on a single detail: *zipper*, *reflection in glasses*, *fingertips on screen*

**Over-the-shoulder:**

Shows character’s perspective.

Example:

- *Over-the-shoulder shot of a driver looking at the road, phone mount glowing softly*

### 🎥 Composition — Expressive, Not Perfect

**What works:**

- *cropped edges*, *negative space*, *foreground blur*, *off-center subjects*
- *spontaneous moments*, *movement blur*, *unbalanced compositions*

Example:

- *A woman walking away from the camera, half her body cropped, her yellow scarf swinging mid-step*

### 🌀 Angles — Add Energy

**Dutch tilt (tilted horizon):**
Adds drama and realism.

Example:

- *Shot at a Dutch angle from behind a vendor cart, the woman steps into a tuk tuk mid-motion*

**Low angle:**
Subject looks stronger or heroic.

Example:

- *Low angle of a man lifting a delivery bag into the trunk, sunlight flaring behind his head*

**High angle:**
Observation, vulnerability, or casual feel.

Example:

- *Top-down shot of a girl scrolling her phone, milkshake in hand, sneakers turned inward*

**Side angle / diagonal frame:**
Adds rhythm and movement.

Example:

- *Side angle of a cyclist riding past a mural, blurred background in motion*

**Avoid:**

- *centered, studio-like shots*
- *symmetrical portraits without action*
- *flat commercial-style lighting*

---

# Ride-hail / Taxi

- Always use a modern white economy car (e.g., Toyota Yaris, Kia Picanto), common for the region.
- Car should be clean, new, recognizable.

- Use different shot types to reflect real ride situations.

**Scenes:**

- Wide: person walking to the car
- Medium: person entering/exiting the car
- Through the window: documentary feel
- Close-up: stepping out, foot still in car

---
