Add an Emotional Layer

Even simple actions become expressive when they carry **inner emotion**. We avoid exaggerated grimaces or fake commercial smiles — we use **subtle, truthful expressions**, like in strong street or fashion photography.

suits confident, fashion-forward looks

*calm focus, soft smirk, relaxed face, present but unreadable*
works for everyday or working scenes

**Lightness / Inspiration**
*gentle smile while looking down, subtle contentment, light posture*
fits quiet, inspiring moments

**Laughter — only between people**
*two people laughing naturally while doing something together*
allowed during interaction, but **not solo**

### Character Appearance  
[keywords: street fashion, layered, textured, accessories, visual hooks]

- Style: Street fashion — eclectic, layered, textured  
- Must-have: Accessories — nails, glasses, jewelry, standout elements
