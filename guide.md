## Characters  
[keywords: clothing, personality, accessories, realism]

Always specify the character’s nationality — for example, Colombian woman, Senegalese man, Zambian girl, Peruvian courier, Nigerian teenager etc.

Use precise present-tense verbs:

**The character should always perform only one action**
Good example: A girl walking parallel to the car
Bad example: A girl zipping her backpack, holding a phone

**Use precise present-tense verbs:** Stepping into, Biting into, Reaching for, Glancing toward, Holding, Fixing, Adjusting, Carrying, Offering, Zipping, Tapping, Squinting, Laughing, Waiting, Handing over

**Avoid:** *Posing, Standing still, Smiling at the camera, Portrait of*

**Examples (Do):**

- *A woman stepping out of a white Toyota Yaris*
- *A courier knocking on a gate with a delivery box under his arm...*
- *A young girl zipping her backpack*

**Examples (Don’t):**

- *A man holding a bag, looking around, fixing his jacket, walking toward the car.*
- *A woman eating, texting, waving, and opening the door.*
- *A teenager running, talking to someone, holding balloons, and smiling.*

Add an Emotional Layer

Even simple actions become expressive when they carry **inner emotion**. We avoid exaggerated grimaces or fake commercial smiles — we use **subtle, truthful expressions**, like in strong street or fashion photography.

### Emotions That Work:
**Calm / Cold**
*expressionless, jaw slightly tense, sharp eyes, neutral lips*
suits confident, fashion-forward looks

**Focused / Self-assured**
*calm focus, soft smirk, relaxed face, present but unreadable*
works for everyday or working scenes

**Lightness / Inspiration**
*gentle smile while looking down, subtle contentment, light posture*
fits quiet, inspiring moments

**Laughter — only between people**
*two people laughing naturally while doing something together*
allowed during interaction, but **not solo**

### Character Appearance  
[keywords: street fashion, layered, textured, accessories, visual hooks]

- Style: Street fashion — eclectic, layered, textured  
- Must-have: Accessories — nails, glasses, jewelry, standout elements  
- Avoid: Plain outfits, "office" looks, over-polished styling  


### Clothing
[keywords: street fashion, layered, textured, accessories, visual hooks]

**Never use local clothing**

## Women’s Looks — Street Fashion

Convey personality through a **modern, eclectic look**.

Note: This is **street fashion**, not mass-market. Combinations should be bold. Accessories should be present, but not overdone.

**What works:**

- **Layers and textures:** mesh, leather, denim, knitwear, sheer fabrics

## Men’s Looks — Street Fashion

**Goal:** Express confidence and style through a **fashion blended street look**. Never overloaded — but there must be a statement. Accessories should be present, but minimal.

- **Modern haircuts:** shaved sides, curls, color accents, neat braids
- **Headwear and scarves:** skullcaps, wraps, bucket hats, bandanas
- **Clothing:** a mix of athletic, designer, and casual wear
- **Clothing:** open shirts, vintage tees, sporty pants with flair
- **Shoes:** sneakers, bulky trainers, sandals with socks

**Example Phrases:**

### Emotion & Posing  
[keywords: natural emotion, movement, walking, glancing, no eye contact]

- Emotion: Honest, subtle — focused, calm, neutral, or quietly fierce  
- Pose: In motion — walking, lifting, glancing. Never staged  
- Eyes: Not at camera — look away, sideways, down  

---

## Locations  
[keywords: urban, context, street, interior, real places]

Showcase country and culture through vibrant, real city context.

Locations must be **urban**, **realistic**, with **texture and personality**.

**Avoid:** parks, trees, greenery, "rural aesthetics."

### Urban Streets (Exterior)

**What works:**
- narrow city alleys*, concrete courtyards, roadside kiosks, *bus terminals, market crossings
- vendors, traffic, signs, exposed wires, billboards, graffiti
- dusty pavement, puddles, crumbling facades, taped posters, neon signs

**Examples:**
- on a cracked sidewalk in downtown Accra, with honking minibuses and street food smoke
- under faded billboards in central Medellín, next to a red tuk-tuk and stacked crates
- walking through a concrete alley in Cairo, graffiti walls and tangled wires overhead
- near a corner shop in Kinshasa, yellow kiosk with hand-painted ads, puddles on the street

**Avoid:**
- trees, palms, grass
- green parks or rural scenery
- country roads or "nature scenes"

**Rules:**
Always show the street from the side — a side-view perspective of a single side of the street: building façades, shop entrances, textured walls, balconies, cables.

Do not show wide symmetrical views of the whole street or street stretching into depth.
Do not describe the time of day in a stylized or cinematic way — avoid phrases like:
“against the harsh midday sun”
“bathed in golden hour light”
“morning haze”, “sunset glow”

Lighting should feel realistic and incidental, like ambient daylight or shadow from nearby buildings.


**Good Examples:**
“A woman walking along a narrow sidewalk, passing faded pink walls and a blue metal gate. Shot from the side, the white car is parked close to the building.”

“A man opening the rear door of a Yaris parked tight against a graffiti-covered wall.”

“A girl stepping toward a tuk tuk, only one side of the street is visible: old apartment balconies, peeling paint, and a broken sign above a metal shop gate.”

**Bad Examples:**
“A man walking down the middle of the street, buildings on both sides, golden hour sun behind him.”
Too wide. Too cinematic.

“A woman stepping out of a car as harsh sunlight flares across the road.”
Avoid stylized sunlight. Keep light natural and unremarkable.

### Background Activity 

The street should never feel empty. There should always be other people present — pedestrians, vendors, cyclists, seated figures — naturally integrated into the environment.

These background characters should appear:
in the background, walking, selling, talking, riding
or in the foreground, out of focus (blurred), cropped, partially visible

They should always be busy with their own tasks — not looking at the camera, not posing, and not interacting directly with the main character.

Use everyday street elements to support realism: benches, bicycles, crates, plants, laundry, handcarts, roadside chairs.

**Good Examples:**
“A woman walking toward a parked Yaris, while a cyclist passes by in the background. Farther behind, a vendor arranges mangoes on a wooden cart.”

“A man getting out of a car as a blurred figure crosses the frame in the foreground, holding plastic bags. Behind him, people sit on a bench under a shop awning.”

“A girl stepping into a tuk tuk. On the sidewalk behind her: an older man reads a newspaper near a cluster of potted plants. A boy walks a bicycle past the camera, slightly out of focus.”

**Bad Examples:**
“A man standing on an empty street, no one else around.”
Feels artificial and staged.

“A woman walking alone on a clean, symmetrical sidewalk.”
Too sterile. Missing texture and life.

### Interiors
Interiors should feel lived-in and cozy — not sterile or showroom-like. The spaces are personal, contemporary, and filled with small, meaningful details that reflect real life: textiles, everyday objects, open shelves, cups, plants, or gadgets. Rooms should feel warm, inhabited, and authentic — without being retro, broken down, or overly styled. Think soft light, visible signs of use, and elements that tell a story. The environment supports the character’s lifestyle and mood, blending effortlessly into the scene rather than standing out as decoration

What to avoid:
Interiors that look like showrooms or hotel rooms
Retro, run-down, or dirty spaces
Sterile or overly generic descriptions

**Do (Examples):**
“Inside a sun-filled kitchen with pale wooden cabinets, open shelves with colorful spice jars, and a kettle whistling on the stove. A cotton towel is draped over the oven handle, and the window curtain dances in the breeze.”

“A tidy living room with soft lighting, framed travel photos on the wall, and a woven basket filled with throw blankets next to a low couch. On the coffee table — a half-full tea mug and a book flipped open.”

“In a compact bathroom with light blue tiles, a toothbrush cup with two mismatched brushes, hand cream on the sink edge, and a mirror slightly fogged from a recent shower.”

**Don’t (Examples):**

“A clean modern kitchen with sleek furniture.”
Too cold and soulless

“A messy old room with broken wallpaper and rusted sink.”
Outdated and off-brand

“A simple bedroom with bed and chair.”
Lacks detail, emotion, and personality

Key elements to include:

Textiles: blankets, curtains, towels, napkins — for warmth

Tableware & food: plates, fruit, mugs, teapots — to add life

Lighting: soft daylight or warm evening tones (not retro)

Objects: books, plants, gadgets, cosmetics, candles — to emphasize modernity and individuality

## Ride-Hail 
[keywords: car, tuk tuk, motorcycle, red vehicle, Yaris, Picanto]

- Use white compact cars common and respectful for the country (Yaris, Picanto)  
- Driver is seated 
- Tuk-tuks and motorcycles should always be red  
- Passengers always sit in the back seat of the car  

### Walking to the car
Rules:
– The passenger is walking to or from the rear door of a white car
- The passenger can be walking parallel to the car
- The driver is already behind the wheel
- The shot captures only one side of the street (side view): building façades, storefronts, gates, textured walls — not a full street overview

Composition is slightly angled, often from the side or low

Examples:
“A woman walking toward the rear door of a white Toyota Yaris, her hand reaching for the handle. Behind her: pastel-painted walls, closed shopfronts, and a hanging wire. The driver is behind the wheel.”
“A man walking away from the car, one foot on the sidewalk, framed by chipped walls and a metal gate. The white Yaris is parked along the curb. Side view with soft golden light.”
“Wide-angle candid photo of a red tuk tuk pulling over on a busy street in Cali, Colombia. A street vendor slices mango into plastic cups under a striped umbrella in the foreground. Mid-frame: a fashionable young man steps out of the tuk tuk mid-motion, wearing baggy navy cargos, a cropped graphic tee under a loose mesh vest, and silver chains that catch the sunlight. His hair is braided with neon beads, and a black fanny pack hangs across his chest. The driver, partly visible in the mirror, adjusts his cap. The camera is angled low with a Dutch tilt, adding tension. Background blur reveals tangled overhead wires, old murals, and a passing moto taxi. Scene feels hot, fast, alive — dust catching the sharp midday light.”
“Wide-angle candid photo of a red tuk tuk pulling into a crowded street corner in Cali. In the foreground: a local man selling mango slices. Mid-ground: a fashionable young man stepping out of the tuk tuk — flared trousers, utility vest, multiple silver necklaces. In the background: the driver, visible in the mirror, wearing a blue button-up. Camera is tilted slightly for dynamism. Motion and street chaos create visual layering”
“A top-angle candid photo of a young Pakistani woman stepping out of a white Toyota Corolla in Lahore. She wears a red velvet shalwar kameez and chunky designer boots, carrying a paper shopping bag. Her long earrings swing as she moves. The car is parked on a narrow street with old bricks, fruit vendors, and motorbikes blurred in motion. Shot from above, cinematic motion, flash used to highlight textures, chaotic but authentic urban vibe”
“A young woman wearing a colorful alpaca wool cardigan swiftly goes to the rear door of white Toyota Corolla 2022, her large, geometric earrings glinting in the glow he morning sun. The scene is set on a busy cobblestone street in central La Paz, Bolivia, surrounded by vibrant market stalls and colonial architecture. The mood is fresh and invigorating, as the Andean light casts long, cool shadows across the scene. The photograph is taken from a high angle, allowing a bird's eye view of the action and providing a panoramic encompass of the old city's charm and chaos.”
“Caught in a wide-shot, a woman wearing an oversized jean jacket decorated with colorful patches, a black dress, bold Doc Marten boots, and rounded mirrored sunglasses, approaches a white Picanto parked in front of a streaked graffiti wall in downtown Barranquilla. The driver leans on the car, his features half-hidden in the shadow of his cap. The scene throbs with life as bikes whiz past in the background, the sun casts long, dramatic shadows across the cobblestone streets, embellishing the city's stoic vibrancy.”
“A young Colombian woman is moving towards the rear end of a red tuk-tuk on a bustling city street. Her outfit mixes streetwear with bold accents — she wears a fitted racer-back tank top under a cropped technical windbreaker with reflective panels, paired with ruched mini shorts and tall ribbed socks. Her accessories include chain necklaces and sunglasses on the head into her curls. Neon yellow nails against her phone, her other hand clutching a metallic micro-backpack. A side view of the street reveals traces of urban life: concrete building with graffiti, a tangle of electric wires, and locals darting by. Using dynamic framing, the shot is captured at a low camera angle.”

### Getting out of the car / tuk tuk
Rules:
- The passenger is getting out from the rear seat
- The driver is behind the wheel, but no mirrors or interior reflections are shown
- The shot shows physical motion: one leg out, torso turning, hand on the door

Examples:
“A woman getting out of the back seat of a white Toyota Yaris, her heel touching the sidewalk. The driver is behind the wheel.”

“A man stepping out, holding a bag close to his body, door wide open. The light casts long shadows across the side of the car.”

Time & Light: Dusty sunlight seeps in from the window adding depth to the scene.  Background Elements: Cars whiz past, a boy sells groundnuts in the near distance, and an old billboard forms the last layer of this urban scene. 
Camera angle & lens: The frame is angled from the front seat offering a side view of the man and the scenery behind.”


“A girl sitting in the back seat of a white Yaris, scrolling through her phone. Through the window: concrete balconies and faded posters. Light hits the stitched leather seat.”

### Sitting in the back of a tuk tuk
Rules:
- The passenger is always seated in the rear bench of the tuk tuk
- The driver is present, simply described as “at the wheel” — no close detail
- Framing may be from the side, from inside, or through the opening

Examples:
“A woman sitting in the back of a red tuk tuk, one hand resting on her lap, the other holding her phone. The driver is at the wheel.”

“Low-angle shot of a Colombian guy sitting sideways in a red tuk tuk, leaning back casually with one leg up. He wears green wide-leg cargo pants, a vintage football jersey, and rectangular sunglasses. His ears are pierced with mismatched hoops. Flash reflects off his sweat-beaded forehead, and his woven crossbody bag rests on his lap. Scene feels hot, real, stylishly gritty”

### Sitting on the back of a motorcycle
Rules:
- Use clear phrasing: “A person sitting behind the driver on the back of a motorbike”
- The driver is always present but only mentioned, not described
