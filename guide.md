# SUPER APP VISUAL GUIDE
Urban Fashion × Documentary Realism

This guide defines non-negotiable visual rules for image generation.
The goal is clean, readable, fashion-forward urban scenes grounded in real life.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- One main character only
- One clear action
- Fashion is dominant
- Environment supports, never overwhelms
- Scenes must read as real exterior city moments
- Clothing must always match the current season

---

## CHARACTER RULES

- Always specify nationality
- One action only (present tense)
- No posing
- No eye contact with the camera
- Emotion is subtle and internal

---

## FASHION & STYLE

Street fashion must feel:
- Bold
- Confident
- Slightly overstyled

Use at least ONE:
- Strong color contrast
- Unexpected layering
- Statement accessory

Avoid:
- Safe, neutral, minimal looks
- Over-accessorizing

---

## SEASONAL CLOTHING RULE (CRITICAL)

Clothing MUST reflect the current season and weather context.

- Hot / summer climate:
  lightweight fabrics, short sleeves, open silhouettes, breathable layers
  (no heavy jackets, coats, scarves, or winter textures)

- Mild or cool weather:
  light jackets, windbreakers, denim, layered tops

- Cold weather:
  coats, puffers, knitwear, scarves, gloves where appropriate

Outfits must feel:
- realistic for the temperature
- comfortable, not styled against the weather
- seasonally believable for the country

Never mix:
summer clothing with cold-weather conditions, or vice versa.

---

## CLOTHING RESTRICTIONS

- No traditional, ethnic, folkloric, or ceremonial clothing
- No ethnic prints or full traditional outfits
- Global street fashion only

Women:
- Bold manicures allowed

Men:
- No colored manicures

---

## LOCATION — EXTERIOR LOGIC (CRITICAL)

Never use words:
street, alley, road, market, sidewalk

Locations must be described through **architectural context**.

Every exterior scene MUST include:
- A building surface
- A transition element (entrance, doorway, corner, gate, step, threshold)
- Spatial positioning (beside, near, along, adjacent to)

The description must clearly signal:
“This person is outside, next to a building in a city.”

### Allowed architectural contexts (choose ONE per scene)
- Residential building entrance with doorbells, mailboxes, tiled steps
- Apartment facade with balconies and visible curtains
- Mixed-use building with a small office or shop entrance
- Corner of a low-rise building with painted plaster and utility boxes
- Recessed doorway with intercom panel and wall-mounted light
- Maintained facade with clean paint and minor wear

Avoid repeating the same facade type across scenes.

---

## REALISM (USED, NOT RUINED)

Urban environments should feel:
- Used
- Maintained
- Lived-in

Avoid:
- Extreme decay
- Slum-like deterioration
- Overly distressed surfaces

Optional realism details (max 1–2):
- Curtains behind windows
- Plants near entrances
- Door numbers or mail slots
- Light reflections on glass or car paint
- Shadows from nearby buildings

---

## VEHICLE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Passenger logic
- Passenger is ALWAYS in the back seat
- If inside the car: **Seat belt fastened** (mandatory)

### Approaching / exiting a car
- Only rear door
- Never front door
- Driver is already inside

### Driver visibility
- Driver always exists logically
- If the scene focuses on the passenger inside the car:
  the driver must NOT be visible in any way
  (no windshield views, no reflections, no silhouettes)

- Describe the driver ONLY if explicitly required
- If visible, describe ONLY the visible part (arm, shoulder, cap edge)

---

## BACKGROUND CONTROL

- Optional
- Maximum ONE secondary figure
- Can be blurred, cropped, or partially visible
- Never interacting with the main character

Empty backgrounds are allowed and often preferred.

---

## CAMERA & COMPOSITION

- Side view or slightly angled
- Cropped, asymmetrical framing
- No wide establishing shots
- Fashion-documentary feel

---

## LIGHT

- Natural or flash light only
- Used to reveal texture
- No cinematic or poetic lighting language

---

## FINAL SANITY CHECK

If the scene could work:
- indoors
- in a studio
- without a city
- in a different season without changing clothes

→ the prompt is wrong and must be rewritten.
