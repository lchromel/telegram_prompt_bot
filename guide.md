# SUPER APP VISUAL GUIDE
Urban Fashion × Documentary Realism

This guide defines strict, non-negotiable visual rules for image generation.
The goal is clean, believable, fashion-forward urban scenes grounded in real life.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- One or two main characters only
- Clear, readable action
- Fashion is dominant
- Environment supports, never overwhelms
- Scenes must read as real urban moments
- Clothing must match season and climate
- Time of day must logically follow the scenario
- Vehicle depiction must match Yango service reality
- Country-based economy car selection is mandatory

---

## CHARACTERS

### Number of characters
- Default: one main character
- Allowed: two main characters when the scenario implies interaction

### Interaction rules (for two characters)
- Characters may interact only with each other
- Interaction must support the scenario
- Both characters must be clearly visible
- Interaction must feel natural, not staged

---

## ACTION RULES

- One clear action per character
- Present tense
- No posing
- No eye contact with the camera
- Emotion is subtle and authentic

---

## PHONE RULE (CRITICAL)

- If a phone is present in the scene, it MUST be a **red phone**
- No other phone colors are allowed
- At least one character should have a red phone when contextually appropriate
- Never mention phone brand/model/interface — only color + interaction

---

## FASHION & STYLE

Street fashion must feel:
- Bold
- Confident
- Slightly overstyled

Use at least ONE:
- Strong color contrast
- Unexpected layering
- Statement accessory

Avoid:
- Safe, neutral, minimal looks
- Over-accessorizing

---

## SEASONAL CLOTHING RULE

Clothing MUST reflect the current season and climate.

- Hot climate: lightweight fabrics, open silhouettes, no heavy outerwear
- Mild/cool: light jackets, denim, layered tops
- Cold: coats, puffers, knitwear, scarves when appropriate

Never style clothing against the weather.

---

## CLOTHING RESTRICTIONS

- No traditional, ethnic, folkloric, ceremonial clothing
- No ethnic patterns or prints
- Global street fashion only

### Grooming
- Women: bold manicures allowed
- Men: NO visible manicures or painted nails

---

## TIME OF DAY LOGIC

Time of day must be inferred from the scenario.
Examples:
- Party / nightlife → evening or night
- Errands / commuting / delivery → daytime
- Early work / school → morning

Never choose time randomly.

---

## LOCATION — EXTERIOR LOGIC

Never use words:
street, alley, road, market, sidewalk

Describe exterior spaces through architecture only.
Must include:
- Building surface
- Transition element (entrance, doorway, corner, step, threshold)
- Spatial positioning (beside, near, along, adjacent to)

## LOCATION QUALITY (LIVED-IN, NOT RUINED)

Avoid decay language: sun-bleached, peeling paint, crumbling, dilapidated, abandoned, heavily weathered.
Use maintained realism instead: intact plaster, clean doorframe, recent repaint patches, functional details.

Add 1–2 life cues max:
doormat, mailboxes, doorbells, utility meter box, potted plant + watering can, bicycle lock, small notice board, curtains behind glass.

Pick ONE exterior context per scene (no repetition):
apartment entrance / office doorway / low-rise corner / residential facade with balcony shadows / simple storefront edge (not markets).

## BACKGROUND PEOPLE (ANTI-CREEPY)

If a background person appears:
- they are turned away or in profile, busy with a task
- never looking at camera, never staring at main characters
- prefer partial/cropped/blurred presence

Never describe: "a person stands in the doorway" or "watching".


---

## REALISM (USED, NOT RUINED)

Urban environments should feel used, maintained, lived-in.
Avoid extreme decay or slum aesthetics.

Optional realism details (max 1–2):
- Curtains, plants, mailboxes, intercoms
- Light reflections, building shadows

---

## VEHICLE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### COUNTRY → ECONOMY CAR MAP (MANDATORY)
Select exactly ONE economy-class car by country:

Ivory Coast → white Suzuki Alto 2019  
Peru → white Toyota Yaris 2020

Morocco → white Dacia Logan 2020  
UAE → white Toyota Camry 2018

Fallback (if country is missing from the map):
white Toyota Corolla 2019

---

### CAR — EXTERIOR SCENES (car visible from outside)
- Use the mapped white economy car for the country (brand + model + year)
- ALWAYS include the exact phrase:
  “with red Yango logotype on the door”

Example format:
white Toyota Corolla 2019 with red Yango logotype on the door

---

### CAR — INTERIOR SCENES (camera inside the car)
- Still use the mapped white economy car for the country (brand + model + year)
- Passengers are always in the back seat
- Seat belt fastened (mandatory)
- Camera POV: from the driver’s seat
- Do NOT mention any logo/branding on the car
- Driver must NOT be visible in any way (no reflections, silhouettes, windshield views)

---

### APPROACHING / EXITING
- Rear door only
- Exterior branding rules apply (logo included)

---

## TUK-TUK RULES
- Tuk-tuks must ALWAYS be red
- Passenger sits in the back
- A driver is ALWAYS present (mandatory)

### Driver visibility control
- If the scene focuses on passenger(s) in the back:
  the driver must NOT be visible in any way
  (no reflections, no silhouettes, no windshield views)
- Describe the driver ONLY if explicitly required by the scenario,
  and only the visible part (shoulder, arm), no invented details

## MOTORCYCLE RULES
- Motorcycles must ALWAYS be red
- A driver is ALWAYS present (mandatory)
- Passenger sits behind the driver

### Driver visibility control
- If the scene focuses on the passenger:
  keep the driver mostly out of frame (cropped or back view)
- Describe the driver ONLY if explicitly required,
  and only visible parts (back/shoulder/helmet edge), no face emphasis

---

## CAMERA & COMPOSITION
- Exterior: side or slightly angled
- Interior: POV from the driver’s seat
- Cropped, asymmetrical, no wide establishing shots

---

## LIGHT
- Natural or flash only
- Texture-focused, no cinematic language

---

## FINAL SANITY CHECK
If:
- phone is not red
- interior mentions logo
- exterior misses logo
- wrong country car
- tuk-tuk/motorcycle not red
- men have manicures
- wrong POV for interior

→ the prompt is invalid.
