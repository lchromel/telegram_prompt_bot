## Service-Specific Notes

### Ride-Hail 
[keywords: car, tuk tuk, motorcycle, red vehicle, Yaris, Picanto]

We create three prompts:
1. The subject is exiting the vehicle (medium shot, with a building in the background).
2. The subject is in the back seat of the vehicle (close-up with a wide-angle lens; outside the window, both buildings and people are visible).
3. The subject is walking away from the vehicle (our subject is in focus; in the foreground, slightly blurred, is a person or structure; in the background — passersby).

- Use white compact cars common and respectful for the country (Yaris, Picanto)  
- Driver is seated — not described  
- Tuk-tuks and motorcycles should always be red  
- Passengers always sit in the back seat of the car  

### Food Delivery  
[keywords: food, steam, eating, home, interaction]

- Focus on delicious food — sauce, steam, textures  
- Include eating, serving, setting, or close-up food details  
- Use dynamic food interaction scenes  

### Parcel Delivery  
[keywords: courier, box, red top, handoff, biking]

- Courier in red top + black bottom (optional red cap)  
- Red kraft box (unbranded)  
- Show: knocking, hand-off, biking, standing with parcel  
- Key frames: hand-over, box detail, street scene
