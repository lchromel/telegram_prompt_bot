# SUPER APP VISUAL GUIDE
Urban Fashion × Documentary Realism

This guide defines strict, non-negotiable visual rules for image generation.
The goal is clean, believable, fashion-forward urban scenes grounded in real life.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- One or two main characters only
- Clear, readable action
- Fashion is dominant
- Environment supports, never overwhelms
- Scenes must read as real urban moments
- Clothing must match season and climate
- Time of day must logically follow the scenario
- Vehicle depiction must match Yango service reality

---

## CHARACTERS

### Number of characters
- Default: one main character
- Allowed: two main characters when the scenario implies interaction

### Interaction rules (for two characters)
- Characters may interact only with each other
- Interaction must support the scenario
- Both characters must be clearly visible
- Interaction must feel natural, not staged

---

## ACTION RULES

- One clear action per character
- Present tense
- No posing
- No eye contact with the camera
- Emotion is subtle and authentic

---

## PHONE RULE (CRITICAL)

- If a phone is present in the scene, it MUST be:
  **a red phone**
- No other phone colors are allowed
- Phone interaction must be natural:
  holding, scrolling, showing something to another person
- At least ONE character should have a phone when contextually appropriate

Never describe phone brand, model, or interface — only color and interaction.

---

## FASHION & STYLE

Street fashion must feel:
- Bold
- Confident
- Slightly overstyled

Use at least ONE:
- Strong color contrast
- Unexpected layering
- Statement accessory

Avoid:
- Safe, neutral, minimal looks
- Over-accessorizing

---

## SEASONAL CLOTHING RULE

Clothing MUST reflect the current season and climate.

- Hot climate: lightweight fabrics, open silhouettes
- Mild climate: light jackets, denim, layered tops
- Cold climate: coats, puffers, knitwear

Never style clothing against the weather.

---

## CLOTHING RESTRICTIONS

- No traditional, ethnic, folkloric, ceremonial clothing
- No ethnic patterns or prints
- Global street fashion only

### Grooming
- Women: bold manicures allowed
- Men: **NO visible manicures or painted nails**

---

## TIME OF DAY LOGIC

Time of day must be inferred from the scenario.

Examples:
- Party / nightlife → evening or night
- Errands / commuting → daytime
- Early work / school → morning

Never random.

---

## LOCATION — EXTERIOR LOGIC

Never use words:
street, alley, road, market, sidewalk

Describe exterior spaces through architecture only.

Must include:
- Building surface
- Transition element (entrance, doorway, corner, step)
- Spatial positioning (beside, near, along)

---

## REALISM (USED, NOT RUINED)

Urban environments should feel:
- Used
- Maintained
- Lived-in

Avoid:
- Extreme decay
- Slum aesthetics
- Over-distressing

Optional realism details (max 1–2):
- Curtains, plants, mailboxes
- Light reflections
- Building shadows

---

## VEHICLE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### CAR — EXTERIOR SCENES

- White economy-class Yango vehicle
- Brand + model + recent body year required
- Always include:
  **“with red Yango logotype on the door”**

Example:
white Toyota Corolla 2018 with red Yango logotype on the door

---

### CAR — INTERIOR SCENES

- Passengers in back seat only
- **Seat belt fastened** (mandatory)
- Camera POV: **from the driver’s seat**
- No logo or branding mentioned
- Driver must NOT be visible

---

### APPROACHING / EXITING

- Rear door only
- Exterior branding rules apply

---

## TUK-TUK RULES

- Always red
- Passenger in the back
- Driver present but not described

---

## MOTORCYCLE RULES

- Always red
- Passenger behind driver
- Driver present but not described

---

## BACKGROUND CONTROL

- Optional
- Max ONE secondary figure
- Blurred / cropped / partial only
- Never interacting

---

## CAMERA & COMPOSITION

- Exterior: side or angled
- Interior: POV from driver’s seat
- Cropped, asymmetrical
- No wide establishing shots

---

## LIGHT

- Natural or flash only
- Texture-focused
- No cinematic language

---

## FINAL SANITY CHECK

If:
- phone color is not red
- logo appears inside the car
- tuk-tuk or motorcycle is not red
- men have manicures
- POV is incorrect

→ the prompt is invalid.
