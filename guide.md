# Super App Visual Guidelines (Short Version)

## Overall Style

### Aesthetic & Principles

- Style: Documentary realism × urban fashion.
- Subjects: Real people (customers, drivers, couriers).
- Look: Unposed, genuine, mid-action.
- Angles: Low, high, Dutch tilt — dynamic framing.
- Lighting: Natural or flash, no filters or heavy editing.
- Color: Natural tones, vibrancy through detail.

## Characters

### Appearance

- Style: Street fashion — eclectic, layered, textured.
- Must-have: Accessories — nails, glasses, jewelry, standout elements.
- Avoid: Plain outfits, "office" looks, over-polished styling.

### Emotion & Posing

- Emotion: Honest, subtle — focused, calm, neutral, or quietly fierce.
- Pose: In motion — walking, lifting, glancing. Never staged.
- Eyes: Not at camera — look away, sideways, down.

## Locations

### Urban Context

- Exterior: Real streets — kiosks, wires, buses, graffiti.
- Interior: Cozy homes — mismatched items, posters, natural light.
- Avoid: Parks, sterile showrooms, overly minimal or rural scenes.

## Framing & Composition

- Vary shots:
  - *Wide*: show place/context
  - *Medium*: action/interaction
  - *Close-up*: nails, food, screen, texture
- Style: Cropped, unbalanced, chaotic. No centered portraits.
- Angles:
  - *Dutch tilt*: adds energy
  - *Low angle*: empowers subject
  - *High angle*: adds casual observation
